  <h2>About Me</h3>
  <p style="font-size: 20px">
  I'm a College Student aspiring to be a Backend Developer, My favorite programming language is Java and <br> wanting to master it. 
  Considering my skills right now, I am not satisfied in terms of my progress. I am an avid gamer, <br> I play games whenever I have the time to but still manage my tasks well. 
  I have a schedule that I always make to be able <br> to manage the things to be done and not forget about it. I also am into making computers may it be looking at pc parts or fixing it.
